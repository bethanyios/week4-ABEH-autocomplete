# week4-ABEH-autocomplete
Ayub, Beth, Gillian and Maria


##DAY 1:
- We spent the morning deciding what kind of data we would like to search for in our input field. After much deliberation we settled on a "Footballers Wives" search which would match a footballers name with his kind of "bird".

- After the CORS filled delight that was API week we decided this time around, as we could actually create and manipulate our own data, to do just that! Ayub found a list of footballers and Beth created a list with her super fast touch-typing skills and used an online resource to combine the two.

- We then created a rough to-do list:
  --pic
  
- A timetable:
  --pic
  
- A basic wireframe of how our GUI and sever would work/appear
  --pic
  
- So our files would be to pushed to github and our desired file architecture could be pulled by each of us and not 'ignored', our initial commit to master was with placeholder information in each file.

 - Once we had a basic structure we split of into pairs and tackled each task on our to-do list in our respective pairs.
 
 GILLIAN/BETH
 - Gillian tackled the basic structure of the HTML page and quickly commited this as a base of operations.
 
 
 AYUB/MARIA
 - We decided to tackle the router and handler files. After looking into the way these had been structured in our workshops we decided that it would likely be the best course of action to follow the same format. As this was how we had learnt to 'connect' files in our src(server) folder, online suggestions varied greatly so we thought it best to stick to what we knew. 
 - We decided to employ the driving instructor technique when writing the code necessary for the files mentioned above. With the instructor allowing the driver to code as much as they recalled, intervening only when the driver had veered off course. We found that when it came to such an unfamiliar topic, this method really helped sure-up our understanding of how our code was connected.
 - The driving instructor would then ask the driver to explain either each line of code in layman terms or as a whole to further ensure that it had been well understood.

##DAY 2
- Taking on Dan's suggestion, we were deleting branches we did not need anymore. 

- We had regular check-ins and made sure to verbally mob anything the respective group may have been struggling with.

 GILLIAN/BETH
 - Beth took it upon herself to mock up our CSS page near-on single handedly whilst we were struggling server-side.
 - Our tests....
 
 
CHALLENGES
- Understanding what every piece of code did
- Understanding how it was all connected so when abstracted it still worked well
- Styling of the CSS drop down list 
- Making sure we required all of the necessary modules in each of our files
- Making sure our filepaths where leading to the correct places, locally and in terms of heroku
- Troubleshooting our code in node, the console and live server
- Making sure that we still had functional code when merging files (usually based on minor changes)
