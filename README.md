# week4-ABEH-autocomplete
Ayub, Beth, Gillian and Maria


##Day 1:
- We spent the morning deciding what we kind of data we would like to search for in our input field.After much deliberation we settled on a "Footballers Wives" search which would match a footballer with his kind of "bird".
- We then created a rough to-do list:

- A timetable:

- A basic wireframe of how our GUI and sever would work/appear

- Taking on Dan's suggestion, we were deleting branches we did not need anymore. 

- Our initial commit to master was with our file architecture.
